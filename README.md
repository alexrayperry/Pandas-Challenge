## Heroes of Pymoli 

In this exercise we are analyzing the data from a csvfile that contains information about players and game purchases.

## Observable Trends

Age Range

* 44.79% of players are in the age range of 20-24 years old. As you look at players that are younger and older than this age range you see a gradual decline in the number of players moving away from the central tendency.

Most Purchased and Profitable Items

* Item ID 178 "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm", Item ID 82 "Nirvana" and Item ID 145 "Fiery Glass Crusader" were the top 3 most purchases add-ons. In addition they were within the top 5 items with the highest purchase value. Given this data, we can assume these are the most popular items and 
because they are the most popular and most profitable, we can focus on creating incentives within the gameplay to purchase these items. This will allow players who may not have purchased these items prior to be incentized to do so, and since the data shows a trend of re-purchase for these add-ons, then user
will likely to re-purchase the add-on and generate more profit. 

* The 5th most popluar item "Pursuit Cudfel of Necromancy" has a total purchase value of $8.16. This value is considerably lower than the 4th most popular item at a difference of []. 
Based on this trend we may want to deincentives, with in the game play, a user from purchases this specific item. Alternatively, we can raise the price of this item.
